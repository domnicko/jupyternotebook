# Linear Regression, Churn Modelling, and Explanatory Data Analysis
This repository contains examples of linear regression, churn modelling, and explanatory data analysis algorithms implemented in Python.

## Linear Regression
In the linear_regression directory, you will find an implementation of linear regression that uses the ordinary least squares (OLS) method to fit a linear model to a given dataset. The implementation includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how the algorithm can be used to predict the price of a house based on various features, such as its size and location.

### Churn Modelling
In the churn_modelling directory, you will find an implementation of a machine learning algorithm that can predict whether a customer will leave or stay with a given company. The implementation includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how the algorithm can be trained on a dataset of customer attributes and transaction history to predict customer churn.

### Explanatory Data Analysis
In the eda directory, you will find examples of how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. The examples include visualizations, summary statistics, and data cleaning techniques that can be used to gain insights into a dataset and prepare it for further analysis.

### Requirements
The code in this repository was written using Python 3.7. To run the examples, you will need to install the following packages:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

### Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
To run the examples, simply open the Jupyter notebook in the appropriate directory and follow the instructions.

### Contributing
If you find a bug or would like to contribute to this project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I am always happy to receive feedback and contributions from the community.
